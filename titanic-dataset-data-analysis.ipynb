Background of the Competition**\n","The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that provides information on the passengers who were onboard the fateful voyage of the RMS Titanic. The data includes details such as the passenger's name, age, gender, ticket class, fare paid, and information on their family members. The dataset also includes a column called \"Survived\" which indicates whether a passenger survived the disaster or not.\n","\n","There are a total of 891 rows in the dataset, with 12 columns. Some of the key columns in the dataset include:\n","\n","• PassengerId: a unique identifier for each passenger\n","• Survived: a binary variable that indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the disaster\n","• Pclass: the ticket class of the passenger (1 = first class, 2 = second class, 3 = third class)\n","• Name: the name of the passenger\n","• Sex: the gender of the passenger (male or female)\n","• Age: the age of the passenger (some values are missing)\n","• SibSp: the number of siblings or spouses the passenger had on board\n","• Parch: the number of parents or children the passenger had on board\n","• Ticket: the ticket number of the passenger\n","• Fare: the fare paid by the passenger\n","• Cabin: the cabin number of the passenger (some values are missing)\n","• Embarked: the port at which the passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n","\n","Overall, the key challenges I encountered when working on the Titanic dataset were: how to handle missing values and imbalanced classes, encode categorical variables, reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and identify and handle noise in the data.\n","\n","Here are a few tips and resources that I found helpful when getting started in the Titanic dataset competition:\n","\n","Get familiar with the dataset\n","Pre-process the data\n","Split the data into training and test sets\n","Try out a few different algorithms\n","Tune the hyper parameters\n","Evaluate the model\n","Here are a few resources that I found helpful as I started Working on the competition:\n","• Kaggle's Titanic tutorial\n","• scikit-learn documentation.\n","• Pandas documentation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"49f77193","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007132,"end_time":"2023-01-09T06:07:32.01506","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T06:07:32.007928","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0b792591","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007001,"end_time":"2023-01-09T06:07:32.029796","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T06:07:32.022795","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **2.
