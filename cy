Hello!!…I hope you are all keeping well from where you are.

I am Cynthia Barasa, a Computer Science graduate and also a Kaggle X Mentee currently working as a Data Centre Operations Engineer.

I am passionate about data science and emerging technologies. I therefore decided to learn data science so that I can fully transition to data science in my career.

I am a self-taught Data Scientist, who works on various projects of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I have done many freelance projects related to data science. I am always willing to learn new things and look for good opportunities.

I love Python, Machine Learning, Time Forecasting, NLP, Deep Learning, pretty visualizations, clean notebooks, and everything in between. 🤍

On the highway to becoming a Data Science Grand Master. 💪 Inshallah.

Please feel free to contact me if you need any help 😊
